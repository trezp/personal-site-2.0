      <p>Ticktickticket is a waitlist app built with JavaScript framework MeteorJS. Ticktickticket auto-refreshes in real-time and can be updated immediately by any student from any phone or browser. I built it while attending coding bootcamp, and it is still used in the classrooms of PDX Code Guild today.</p>

      <p>The Beaverton Literacy Council serves parents of public school children who want to improve their English speaking skills. The site is accessed primarily by children translating for their parents, and so was designed and built for simplicity and ease of use. Built using Zurb Foundation, JQuery, and JQuery UI. Basic graphics for the site are from freepik but heavily altered by me.</p>

      <p>Light Years, based on the classic French card game Milles Bornes, was my first foray into Object Oriented JavaScript and MeteorJS. It is still very much in development, but the code demonstrates my knowledge of more advanced programming concepts and my ability to work with JavaScript frameworks.  </p>
